Stream: Stream is just a process of flow of data from the data source 
to the buffer and from the buffer to the client.All these bits flow in a stream.

Buffer: Transferring a big amount of data after converting it into small chunks of data. 
These small chunks can be used simultaneously, without waiting for the whole amount of the data to download.
For example - Watching a youtube video,without downloading the whole file.
