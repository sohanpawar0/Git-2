event loop takes care of the javascript asynchronous code, basically javascript is a single threaded 
programming language. When any asynchronous is encountered, the code is thrown to certain portion of 
memory which is different from the javascript execution, and attached a event listener with it.
Whenever the event occurs, the callback functiona associated with it comes to the callback queue and
event loop takes care of these functions, it brings the callback function one by one to the call stack
and executes it. Thus as long as any event listener is there in the code, the event loop waits for 
any event to happen, after it happens it brings the function to call stack and loop goes on. When there
is no event is there, the program gets terminated.
